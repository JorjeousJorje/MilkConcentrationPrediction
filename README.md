# MilkConcentrationPrediction
 
This repo holds code of an ANN model that was designed to predict milk concentration of the spherical droplets by the shape of the light scattering signal.
The model was designed and trained by NSU student Georgy Bakharev.

The model was designed using Pytorch framework.

Actual model can be found in "ConvRegressor.py" file.
The model, presented in the article, can be found in "trained models" directory.
